# Julian Boralli's reflection for GPS 2.1 assignment

##Here are my thoughts:

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I think I needed to exercise the local/remote connection, as well as, better understand the overall flow process. The assignment was very helpful in that sense.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

First, the overall pairing process. And second, the git / github workflow, specifically how to workflow happens in team projects.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

We spent some time discussing the pull command. Basically trying to understand what fetch and merge do.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I am not particularly confused now, but there is so much to learn in Git that I still feel like a beginner.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS**

It was great! I believe we went through the right steps of the pairing process. Time management was a bit hard, but I think we'll improve with practice.
