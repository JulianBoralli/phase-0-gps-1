# Tao's Reflections

## Reflections for GPS 1.1 Version Control (Git)

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

>I was struggling with some of the finer code phrases, like the difference between pull and fetch. I also needed to review the merge command on my local terminal. Overall the entire workflow I feel that I understand well. When to commit, how to create branches, how to push to a repository.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

>I now know the difference and how to use pull/fetch, as well as merging I am more comforatble. My partner Julian also knew a lot of commands that made the entire git and github workflow process more streamlined and efficient.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

>This was my first guided pairing, I didn't really have too many questions for my guide since I didn't know what to expect. However my pair was very good at explaining things as we moved forward, and like I said before he knew a lot of new things that I am going go try and pick up on to make everything more efficient. A lot of my questions I just wanted clarification that I was doing everything correctly.

* What still confuses you about Git?

>Hopefully not too much! I feel as though the entire workflow process has been ingrained into my head and I feel pretty comfortable.

* How was your first experience of pairing in GPS?

>I wasn't really sure what to expect but it helped that I had a good guide and a good pair. Figuring things out together made it a bit easier to me than just always going at it on my own. Once we got into it a few minutes in it became more comfortable and everything progressed very smoothly.
